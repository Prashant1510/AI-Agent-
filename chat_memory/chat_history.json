    "content": "The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.  Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow.  As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).  These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.  Rayleigh scattering causes shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, to scatter more strongly than longer wavelengths, like red and orange.  This scattered blue light is what we see when we look at the sky.  Violet light is actually scattered even more than blue, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and the sun emits slightly less violet light, resulting in a blue sky."
